 *
 * You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new
 * product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality
 * check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all
 * the versions after a bad version are also bad.
 * 
 * Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the
 * first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
 * 
 * You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether
 * version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You
 * should minimize the number of calls to the API.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.
 * 
 * call isBadVersion(3) -> false
 * call isBadVersion(5) -> true
 * call isBadVersion(4) -> true
 * 
 * Then 4 is the first bad version.

// The API isBadVersion is defined for you.
// bool isBadVersion(int version);

// start + 1 < end, 最终剩余2个, 结束要start，end各判断一遍
class Solution {
public:
    int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int start = 1;
        int end = n;
        while (start + 1 < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
                end = mid;
            } else {
                start = mid;
            }
        }
        return isBadVersion(start) ? start : end;
    }

// start < end mid值偏左，所以start要加1
